    <h1> STATS 32: Final Project & Proposal</h1>

    <p>Click <a target="_blank" href="STATS 32 Final Project Guidelines.pdf">here</a> for a PDF version of the final project guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Final Project (80%)</h2>
    <p>To demonstrate your understanding of the material we have covered, you will perform a data analysis project in R. <b>Each person should submit their own project.</b> While you may discuss ideas and troubleshoot code with each other, each person must submit a unique project.</p>

    <p>Here are the project minimum requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 .Rmd file, as well as 1 .html file. (Don't worry about what these file formats are and how to create them right now; we'll talk about this in Week 3.)</li>
      <li>Use a dataset that we have not used in class. If using an external dataset, provide the data file and/or a link to it.</li>
      <li>An "Introduction" section describing the problem and the datasets to be used.</li>
      <li>A "Data analysis" section where you have code. Code should have accompanying text that describes what the code is doing and interprets the results.</li>
      <li>At least 3 data visualizations (not all of the same type).</li>
      <li>A "Conclusion" section to summarize the results of the analysis, as well as any deviations from the project proposal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Proposal (20%)</h2>
    <p>For the project proposal, submit a 1-2 paragraph description of your final project. You should provide details on the problem you wish to explore, any datasets that you will use, and potential visualizations. The proposal is a way for me to make sure that you have enough structure and data to complete the project.</p>

    <p>The project proposal should be submitted as a text file (any format will do).</p>

    <p>In implementing your final project, you should try to stick as closely to your proposal as possible. If you are unable to do so, please provide a paragraph in your final project to explain the deviations from the proposal.</p>

    <h2>Grading & Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Both the project proposal and final project should be submitted through Canvas.</p>

    <p>The project proposal is due by <b>Oct 19 (Fri), 23:59:59</b> and is worth 20%.</p>

    <p>The final project is due by <b>Nov 2 (Fri), 23:59:59</b> and is worth 80%.</p>

    <p>For each late day, a multiplicative penalty factor of 0.8 will be applied. Work that is submitted more than 2 days after the due date will receive <b>0 points</b>. If you foresee that you may have difficulty meeting these deadlines, please come and speak with me <b>immediately</b>.</p>

    <h2>What might the final project look like?</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of good student projects from previous runs of this class:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="world_happiness_analysis-1.html">World Happiness Analysis</a>, Clementine Chou.</li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="College_Data.html">An (Incomprehensive) Analysis of the College Scorecard Data</a>, Alex Hurtado.</li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="Oregon Timber Harvest-1.pdf">Oregon Timber Harvest</a>, Sierra Killian.</li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="SAT_Score_Analysis.html">SAT Score Analysis</a>, Angela Luo.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are some examples that I found online which would fit what I'm looking for in a final project:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>I don't really have ideas for what data to use...</h2>
    <p>Here are some ideas for datasets that you might want to explore:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Governmental or NGO open data websites (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="http://data.cityofpaloalto.org/home">City of Palo Alto</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.ca.gov/">State of California</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>)</li>
