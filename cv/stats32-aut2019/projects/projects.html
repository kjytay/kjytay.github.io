    <h1> STATS 32: Final Project & Proposal</h1>

    <p>Click <a href="STATS 32 Final Project Guidelines.pdf">here</a> for a PDF version of the final project guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Final Project (80%)</h2>
    <p>To demonstrate your understanding of the material we have covered, you will perform a data analysis project in R. <b>You may choose to do a project on your own or with one other teammate.</b> (If working with a teammate, only one person has to submit the work. The names and SUNet IDs of both teams should be clearly labeled.)</p>

    <p>Here are the project minimum requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 .Rmd file, as well as 1 .html file. (Don't worry about what these file formats are and how to create them right now; we'll talk about this later in the course.)</li>
      <li>Work with a dataset not used in class. Provide the data file and/or a link to it. My advice is to use a dataset that is in .csv or .txt format, as these will be easier to import into R.</li>
      <li>An "Introduction" section describing the problem and the datasets to be used. This should include top-level summaries of the data (e.g. how many observations and features, histogram/scatterplots of values, anything unusual).</li>
      <li>A "Data analysis" section where you have both code and accompanying text describing what the code is doing and interpreting the results.</li>
      <li>At least 3 data visualizations, each of a different type. (If working with a teammate, at least 6 data visualizations, with at least 3 different types.)</li>
      <li>A "Conclusion" section to summarize the results of the analysis, as well as any deviations from the project proposal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While your analysis should not be too skimpy, it does not have to be comprehensive either. Take a look at the links below for examples of what the final project could look like, as well as ideas for datasets which you might want to work on.</p>

    <h2>Project Proposal (20%)</h2>
    <p>For the project proposal, submit a 1-2 paragraph description of your final project. You should provide details on the problem you wish to explore, any datasets that you will use, and potential visualizations. The proposal is a way for me to make sure that you have enough structure and data to complete the project.</p>

    <p>The project proposal should be submitted as a text file (any format will do).</p>

    <p>In implementing your final project, you should try to stick as closely to your proposal as possible. If you are unable to do so, please provide a paragraph in your final project to explain the deviations from the proposal.</p>

    <h2>Grading & Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Both the project proposal and final project should be submitted through Canvas.</p>

    <p>The project proposal is due by <b>Oct 16 (Wed), 23:59:59</b> and is worth 20%.</p>

    <p>The final project is due by <b>Nov 2 (Sat), 23:59:59</b> and is worth 80%.</p>

    <p>For each late day, a multiplicative penalty factor of 0.8 will be applied. Work that is submitted more than 2 days after the due date will receive <b>0 points</b>. If you foresee that you may have difficulty meeting these deadlines, please come and speak with me <b>immediately</b>.</p>

    <h2>What might the final project look like?</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of good student projects from previous runs of this class:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>I don't really have ideas for what data to use...</h2>
    <p>Here are some ideas for datasets that you might want to explore:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Governmental or NGO open data websites (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="http://data.cityofpaloalto.org/home">City of Palo Alto</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.ca.gov/">State of California</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>)</li>

      <li>Data which you have collected yourself</li>
    </ul>
