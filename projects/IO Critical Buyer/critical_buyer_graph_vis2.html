    <h1>Input-Output Table Visualisation: Critical Buyers</h1>

    <p>Each node in the visualisations below represents one of the 127 sectors of the Singapore economy.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The size of the node represents its total output (includes exports and final domestic demand).</li>
      <li>The colour of the node represents the cluster it belongs to.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The links depict "critical buyer" relationships: a link is drawn from A to B (follow the arcs in a clockwise manner) if B is a critical buyer of A.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The thicker the link (from A to B), the larger the percentage of A's output purchased by B.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This visualisation is mildly interactive. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hover over a node to see its description,</li>
      <li>Double-click a node to see its total demand and linkages. Orange links go to sectors which the node is a critical buyer of, while blue links go to sectors which are critical buyers of the node.</li>
      <li>Hover over a link to see the buyer and supplier in the relationship, as well as the percentage of the supplier's output going to the buyer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Due to software limitations, I was not able to draw links from a sector to itself.</p>

    <h2>Notes for this version</h2>
    <p>Links only appear when a node is double-clicked. A link from A to B is only drawn if B is one of A's top 5 buyers and B buys more than 10% of A's output. Exports and Domestic Demand are included as nodes.</p>
