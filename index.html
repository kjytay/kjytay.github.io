	      <p>I am a data scientist with Linkedin's <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/data-science/applied-research-productivity">Data Science and Applied Research (DSAR)</a> team. I earned my PhD in Statistics at <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> in 2021, advised by <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/">Rob Tibshirani</a>. I am interested in all things statistics, but especially in developing statistical software, understanding how statistical analyses can impact decision-making more effectively, as well as how statistics is communicated to the public and in the classroom.</p>

	      <p>I have prior internship experience as a data scientist with the payments organization in Google, and as an applied scientist with and experimentation team in Amazon Search. Before that, I worked in the Singapore Government for 5 years in various roles: a data scientist at IDA Singapore's Data Science Division (now under <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/">GovTech</a>), and public policy roles in Singapore's (then) <a href="http://www.mse.gov.sg/">Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources</a> and Ministry of Defence.</p>

        <p>I am also an avid blogger! Here are my blogs, in decreasing posting frequency:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/">Statistical Odds & Ends</a>: Short posts about concepts and ideas in statistics and related fields which interest me. This is also a place for me to clarify some of my thoughts and pen down notes for future reference.</li>
          <li><a href="https://mathematicaloddsandends.wordpress.com/">Mathematical Odds & Ends</a>: As above, but for math that is non-stats.</li>
          <li><a href="https://beyondmathsolutions.wordpress.com/">Beyond Solutions</a>: Solutions to math olympiad problems and brainteasers, written with the intent of illuminating the problem-solving process.</li>
