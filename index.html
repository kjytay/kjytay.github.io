	<p>I am a recent PhD graduate of Stanford's <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, advised by <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/">Rob Tibshirani</a>. I am broadly interested in statistical learning, with specific interests in developing interpretable models which leverage structure in the data for better performance. I am also really interested in developing statistical software, understanding how statistical analyses can impact decision making more effectively, as well as how statistics is communicated to the public and in the classroom.</p>

	<p>I have prior internship experience as a data scientist with the payments organization in Google, and as an applied scientist with and experimentation team in Amazon Search. Before that, I worked in the Singapore Government for 5 years in various roles: a data scientist at IDA Singapore's Data Science Division (now under <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/">GovTech</a>), and public policy roles in Singapore's (then) <a href="http://www.mse.gov.sg/">Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources</a> and Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>I run a blog, <a href="https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/">Statistical Odds & Ends</a>, where I write short posts about concepts and ideas in statistics and related fields which interest me. This is also a place for me to clarify some of my thoughts and pen down notes for future reference; hopefully it can be of use to others! :)</p>
