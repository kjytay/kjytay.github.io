	<p>I am a rising 5th-year PhD student with Stanford's <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, advised by <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/">Rob Tibshirani</a>. I am broadly interested in statistical learning, with specific interests in developing methods which leverage structure in the data or feature information to yield better prediction and inference. I am also really interested in understanding how statistical analyses can have a great impact on decision making, as well as how statistics is communicated to the public and in the classroom.</p>

	<p>I am currently a data scientist intern with the payments team in Google, and have prior internship experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A9.com">Amazon Search</a>'s experimentation team. Before that, I worked in the Singapore Government for 5 years in various roles: a data scientist at IDA Singapore's Data Science Division (now under <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/">GovTech</a>), and public policy roles in Singapore's (then) <a href="http://www.mse.gov.sg/">Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources</a> and Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>I run a blog, <a href="https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/">Statistical Odds & Ends</a>, where I write short posts about concepts and ideas in statistics and related fields which interest me. This is also a place for me to clarify some of my thoughts and pen down notes for future reference; hopefully it can be of use to others! :)</p>

	<p>My wife runs a really cool blog titled <a href="https://techandpublicgood.com/">Technology and Public Good</a>, where she discusses how the tech, business and government sectors can work together to solve social challenges. Together, we have two beautiful daughters who never fail to make us laugh :)</p>
