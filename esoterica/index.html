<h2>Esoterica</h2>

Inspired by Christian Lawson-Perfect's <a href="https://read.somethingorotherwhatever.com/">Interesting Esoterica</a> page, this is a page of references that I have found interesting over the years. Some of them talk about practical matters; others don't. I just find them stimulating enough to keep them on hand.

May some of these references spark joy (or ideas!) in your own life!

Tay, 2022. <a href="https://mathematicaloddsandends.wordpress.com/2022/04/08/conways-fruitful-fractions-or-how-to-generate-all-the-prime-numbers-by-multiplying-one-of-14-fractions/">Conway’s fruitful fractions (or how to generate all the prime numbers by multiplying one of 14 fractions)</a>. Really interesting how he encodes a computer program that generates all the prime numbers with multiplication of fractions.</li>
